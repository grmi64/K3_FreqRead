myCreate allows one to control basic movements of the iCreate Robot
using the mouse or keyboard on your Apple OS X 10.5 and higher
system.&nbsp; <br>
First, select the correct serial device&nbsp; from the pull down
list.&nbsp; If using Bluetooth, the correct device will probably be
'/dev/tty.ElementSerial-ElementSe'.&nbsp; Once the device is open then
your iCreate can be controlled using the buttons on the application
panel or via the arrow keys on your keyboard.&nbsp; The Space bar
corresponds to the 'Stop' button.&nbsp; The buttons and keyboard are
disabled until the open is successful.<br>
Use the slider control to vary the speed at which the robot
travels.&nbsp; The distance traveled between each control activation is
displayed as well as the total distance traveled since the port was
opened.&nbsp; To return the robot to an idle state simply quit the
application.<br>
